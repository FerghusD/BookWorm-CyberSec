							<h2> Why Care About Security? </h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong> Intro </strong> In our present day and age, information may as well be the new global currency. It 
								seems like everywhere you go people are trying to get information on you. Every 
								company nowadays has a loyalty account where they mask information collection 
								as a thing that benefits you by giving you sales and discounts on products. Even 
								more recently, cookies and other website analytics have come into the spotlight as 
								needing regulation. Those are the ways people know their information is being 
								compromised and taken, but just as the devil you know is better than the devil you 
								don’t, a major concern are in the ways it is being compromised without a user 
								knowing. These methods are often more malicious in nature and represent a very 
								real threat on many levels.
								</br></br>
								Information can be anything that reveals aspects of you to another entity, but part 
								of the severity comes from how the entity plans to use it. Some of the more 
								harmless applications of it are for marketing and sales purposes, but more 
								malicious endeavors will be along the lines of identity theft and financial theft. If a 
								company becomes compromised, the potential ramifications are exponentially more
								drastic as they deal with many people and much more money than if a single 
								person becomes compromised. Even in Calgary we have been witness to many 
								cyber attacks that result in leaking of private information. In 2016 we had the 
								University of Calgary ransomware attack where the attacker demanded $20,000 in 
								ransom, and in the same year we witnessed Cowboys Casino patron and customer 
								information compromised. More recently, Professional Excavators and Construction 
								were targeted by a different ransomware attack and was measured to be worth 
								over $100,000 to get everything up and running. The scary part is that people are 
								willing to pay to get this information back, meaning they admit the information 
								contained has value. Just like your house and belongings, things with value need to 
								be protected.
								Take a look through the site to learn some habits and methods you can use to 
								improve network safety!</p>

							<h2> How do you secure yourself? </h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong> The </strong> unfortunate reality is there isn’t a way to secure yourself 100% from everything the world can throw at you; if there was, security would be a non-issue and there would be no need for security analysts. Security itself is more of a spectrum than a simple yes/no; there are different things you can do to help make your system more secure, therefore harder to compromise. 
							This is a concept called hardening. Hardening takes place on many levels: OS, network, program etc.  While large technical endeavors are likely out of reach, there are many ways you can harden your own environment even just by changing your habits and tendencies. The following will contain a few ways you can promote system security:</p>

							<div class="content">
								<div class="gallery">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
								<p> <strong> VPN, </strong> which stands for Virtual Private Network is a great way of securing your 
								information. When you are connected to a network that is being shared by many 
								other devices (like a library, or coffee shop hotspot), a VPN will segment part of that
								network that only you can access. If the VPN is encrypted, it means the other users 
								beside you won’t have access to the data you send and receive through it unless 
								you give them access to the same VPN network you’re using. <div class="gallery"> <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span> </div>  
								While a VPN is never 100% secure and foolproof, it adds a large barrier between you and other users of a
								network connection that works to block access to your system.
								A good practice is to use a VPN especially when you’re working with sensitive 
								documents. Browsing a YouTube video at a coffee shop is probably ok and won’t be 
								an issue most of the time. When you’re working with sensitive information like client
								information and banking, it is wise to use a VPN to secure that traffic in 
								transmission.

								<p> <strong> Ever </strong> taken a look at the URL bar on your website, and sometimes you see http:// 
								and others you see https:// ? The websites that include the ‘s’ are using a secure 
								web server instead of an insecure one. This means that there are much fewer risks 
								associated with those websites as they have their own security layer implemented 
								right into it. That’s not to say you shouldn’t ever use a website that doesn’t have 
								the ‘s’ in the URL, or that every website with the ‘s’ is a safe website, it means that 
								you need to be mindful of what you do on said website. The non-secure websites mean your actions are more easily tracked and traced, 
								and the information you enter (like account logins and passwords) can be plainly 
								viewed by anyone who has connected to the website. Insecure websites like these 
								are fine for reading, playing games, and even watching media, but are not suitable 
								for aspects like banking or sharing sensitive information.</p>

							<h3> Mindfulness and Caution with Sensitive Information </h3>
							<p> Bottom Text </p>
						</header>
							<div class="content">
							
								<p> <strong> This </strong>  is more of a habit than a specific barrier that exists. Part of our demonstration 
								is being able to show you the types of information that can be gleaned by just 
								viewing the network packets that are sent and received through a network. If 
								information is not encrypted and is displayed as plain text, it can be viewed easily 
								by many people that probably shouldn’t have access to it. Things like account 
								numbers, credit card numbers and accounts names/passwords can be intercepted 
								easily if they are entered as plain text anywhere. In the physical world, this is akin 
								to having a sticky note with a password to a computer, stuck to the computer the 
								password is for, or leaving a key to your house dangling on a string on the 
								doorknob.
								A common thing that people do is download their paystubs and tax information 
								from a secure source, then send it to a personal email account. The contents of that
								file can be easily be viewed if that email is intercepted. Because paystubs have 
								identifying and financial information on them, these documents can hold a high 
								value

							<h3> Email End to End Encryption </h3>
							<p> Bottom Text </p>
						</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p> <strong> Encryption </strong> works similarly to a secret language that you make with friends and 
								other close peers that only you and them know. If you speak with those people who 
								know the language, other people who do not cannot listen in unnoticed. Encryption 
								is the process of taking information and scrambling it based on a random algorithm.
								Only the target user or group has the ‘key’ to decipher the encrypted message and 
								view its contents, therefore securing the message from prying eyes.
								Many email providers use a mix of encrypted/unencrypted transmissions. Google, 
								for example, stores the email you create as a plaintext file when you send it, and 
								only encrypts it when it sends it to the recipient. This means that Google (and 
								anyone with unauthorized access) can view the contents of your emails. You might 
								have seen this in action if you send an event email in Outlook, and Outlook asks you
								if you want to add it to your calendar.
								
								</br></br>
								With that considered, end to end encryption means your email is encrypted the 
								moment it is sent from your device to the recipient. Emails sent like this cannot be 
								stored as plaintext on a server which significantly boosts how secure your emails 
								are. While companies like Google aren’t snooping in your emails to try and steal 
								your identity or money, and instead use information for improving their services or 
								providing you with more efficiency, eliminating this area means that the people able
								to see the contents are drastically reduced.

							<h3> Additional Considerations in The Corporate Environment </h3>
							<p> Bottom Text </p>
						</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p> <strong> Corporate </strong> systems contain more information than personal systems, meaning that 
								an increased level of caution and focus should be exercised when using corporate 
								devices and services. While the previous tips and pointers are going to be beneficial
								to the general populace, the following are a couple good habits to practice in the 
								corporate environment to maintain security standards.
								
								</br></br>
								<strong> Follow Established Protocols </strong></br>
								
								Odds are, if you work for a company that hands out devices for you to use, they 
								have their own security protocols they follow. While the previous suggestions are 
								always good to practice, protocols your company creates are guidelines you should 
								be following and take priority over anything else. In many cases the corporate 
								protocols and procedures are more thorough than many of the things you can do on
								your own as an individual, and are created to deal with the corporate information 
								appropriately. Some general examples of this are:</br></br>
								- Changing your passwords frequently in case one gets compromised</br>
								- Do not reuse passwords</br>
								- Use established software/hardware provided</br></br>
								Protocols usually cover a wide variety of applications to maintain both your personal
								and corporate security when connecting to a public network. This can include things
								like not-accessing certain sensitive resources while on a public network, or using a 
								VPN to encrypt your traffic when connecting to corporate servers.</br></br>
								
								<strong> Don't Connect to Non-Essential Sites and Services with Work Account and Devices </strong></br>
								Another important way to promote security in public network environments is to 
								only use corporate credentials and devices for corporate purposes. Everything you 
								do online and every system you use is something that can b potentially be exploited
								and used as a vector for attack. When using corporate devices and systems, it is 
								safe to abstain from engaging in non-work activity, for if your device becomes 
								compromised, it acts as a gateway into the rest of the corporate environment.</br></br>
								If you are on a personal device, and accidentally click on an ad that infects your 
								computer with malware, your personal computer is infected. If you were to do the 
								same with a corporate device, or a device that can connect to corporate services, 
								your device and the entire corporate network are compromised. This can lead to a 
								substantial loss of data, information, revenue, and company reputation in the 
								marketplace.

							<h3> Demonstration </h3>
							<p> Bottom Text </p>
						</header>
							<div class="content">
							
								<p> <strong> We have </strong> an in-person demonstration prepared for when a venue wants us to 
								demonstrate how easy it is for data to become compromised. It utilizes a discreet 
								microcomputer housed inside of a hollowed out book to monitor the network it is 
								attached to. The Bookworm can detect unencrypted traffic with ease as long as it is 
								connected to the network itself. By capturing the packets with this device, we can 
								provide a tangible way for people to understand how information flows into and out 
								of a network, and the types of information that can be seen by a scrying eye.
